# VS Code

Most of our team is using VS Code for an editor. VS Code has excellent typescript support,
as well as good tools for working with solidity.

## Extensions

Here are some extensions that we've found useful:

* [VS Code Solidity](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity) - for solidity code
  highlighting and linting
* [LaTeX Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) - for compiling and previewing
  latex (used to write the paper)
* [Vim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) - if Vim keybindings are your thing ..

## Debugging

VS Code has some excellent debugging support built in, allowing you to set breakpoints and
walk through code in the editor itself.
