# The Magmo Dev Handbook

This book is meant to serve as a resource for developers working at Magmo (and potentially
the wider community :)). It describes the tools we use to work with the ethereum ecosystem
and how we use them. The book is being written by the Magmo team, as we learn about the
space, so a lot of the content might be very sub-optimal or just plain wrong. Please use
with caution and let us know if you can see any improvements that we can make!
