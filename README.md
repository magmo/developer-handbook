# The Magmo Dev Handbook

As a newcomer, the ethereum ecosystem can be little overwhelming. There are many new concepts
to learn and a lot of the developer tooling is still in its infancy. While some great sources
of information and great developer tools exist, it can be hard to navigate the different options. 

**The purpose of this book is to describe the tools we're using to work with the ethereum ecosystem
and how we use them.**

It isn't meant to be an authoritative "this is how you should do it" type book but more of a
"here are some things we found that worked and here are some problems we're still having".
The book is being written by the Magmo team, as we learn about the space, so a lot of the
content might be very sub-optimal or just plain wrong.

This book is primarily meant to be resource for developers working at Magmo. We've decided to
open source it (a) in case it's useful to other teams in the community and (b) so we can
more easily gather feedback from the community to improve our approach.

Please use with caution and let us know if you can see any improvements that we can make!
